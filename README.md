# Nomifactory-migrator
This script will migrate save data and other important files between versions of the Nomifactory and Nomifactory CEu modpacks. Original repo: https://github.com/capSAR273/omnifactory-migrator.

**How to Use:**
Open the .ps script with Powershell, and follow the prompts. If using the Python script, open it using a terminal and follow the prompts.

**Note: If you get existing file errors do not worry, the script overwrites the existing files to ensure you have the latest from your old pack's folder.**
