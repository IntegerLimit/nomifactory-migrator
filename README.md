# omnifactory-migrator
This script will migrate save data and other important files between development versions of the Omnifactory modpack found here: https://github.com/OmnifactoryDevs/Omnifactory

**How to Use:**
Open the .ps script with Powershell, and follow the prompts. If using the Python script, open it using a terminal and follow the prompts.

**Note: If you get existing file errors do not worry, the script overwrites the existing files to ensure you have the latest from your old pack's folder.**
