# Nomifactory Updater
This script will migrate save data and other important files between versions of the Nomi-CEu Modpack. This also works with the Nomifactory Modpack. Original repo: https://github.com/capSAR273/omnifactory-migrator. Most of the work is done by him, I've just rebranded it, and edited it to work with the new HEI bookmark storage system.

**How to Use:**
Open the .ps script with Powershell, and follow the prompts. If using the Python script, open it using a terminal and follow the prompts.

**Note: If you get existing file errors do not worry, the script overwrites the existing files to ensure you have the latest from your old pack's folder.**
